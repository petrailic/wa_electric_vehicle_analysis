### Reproducibility Report

The analysis was successfully reproduced. The code was able to be run without any modification, except the path. 

### Overall opinion

This is a well-structured and clearly documented project.
- The folder organization follows good reproducibility.
- The instruction in the README are clear and easy to follow. 
- The python script is clean and well-documented. 
- The analysis is minimal, clear, and produces an interpretable plot. 

## Suggested improvements
- Add a short textual summary of the result either in the README or as printed output in the script. 
- Add a small data description or data dictionary in the README to make it clearer what variables are included in the dataset.
